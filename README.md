# pongtk
Pong game written in tkinter

Why not use pygame or some other library which is more suitable for creating a game?
-I simply wanted to learn tkinter, since it's the standard python library.

Known bugs/issues:
-When the paddle is moving towards the ball it's increasing more score then it should
